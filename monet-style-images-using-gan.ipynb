That isn't necessarily bad because the initial models still looked mostly like photos with a bit of blur. My last model just took blur too far\n* I am going to label this as my own artistic style and submit the notebook with the blurry images instead of the models based more heavily on tutorials\n\n* By following the example without modificatation, the score was 55.85414\n* After starting with an example, I compared it with the instructor slides and walked through a few other examples\n* I kept much of the \"glue\" code from the first example because it was mostly class setup\n* I focused on editing the hyperparameters of the model and changing the layers\n  * Some of my edits went full circle back \n  * Such as the upscaling and downscaling. I adjusted that back and forth and ended up keeping it as it was in the orginal example\n* None of my edits improved on the score I got from Amy Yang's tutorial but it was fun to experiement with different options. \n* My score on the notebook with the fuzzy images that I am showing here was 110. I published this notebook because I liked the images despite the score.","metadata":{}}]}
